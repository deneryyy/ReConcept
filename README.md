# ReConcept
### A Fabric mod reconceptualizing Minecraft survival game progress and its mechanics.
### !WARNING! This mod is in early alpha stages of development and isn't really playable yet. Release date is unknown.

Main philosophies of this mod:
1. Strict vertical and horizontal game progression. Dividing the game into stages which player cannot skip, but giving multiple options in game progress too.
2. No global player ranks or any visible characteristics defining game progress which affect the game.
3. Reuse vanilla content for the sake of building new progression when possible. New content allowed too.
4. Eliminate any possibilities to create automated farms or any other kind of mechanism automating game progress for the player.

TODO:
- [ ] Define vanilla content which should be accessible in the 1st stage of game progress and make player access it all before going into the 2nd stage.
- [ ] Make it harder to explore the world in the 1st stage of game progress
- [ ] Make it impossible to access other dimensions in 1st stage of game progress
- [ ] Rework food and hunger
- [ ] Rework player characteristics to be upgradable
- [ ] Rework redstone to make it harder or impossible to make auto farms.
- [ ] Rework villagers (or remove them entirely?)
- [ ] Rework inventory
