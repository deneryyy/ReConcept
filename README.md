# ReConcept
### A Fabric mod reconceptualizing Minecraft survival game progress and its mechanics.
### !WARNING! This mod is in early alpha stages of development and isn't really playable yet. Release date is unknown.

Main philosophies of this mod:
1. Strict vertical and horizontal game progression. Dividing the game into stages which player cannot skip, but giving multiple options in game progress too.
2. No global player ranks or any visible characteristics defining game progress which affect the game.
3. Reuse vanilla content for the sake of building new progression when possible. New content allowed too.
4. Eliminate any possibilities to create automated farms or any other kind of mechanism automating game progress for the player.
